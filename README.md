# SkeletalAnimation
Rendering engine supporting skeletal animations using glTF assets.

Most assets were downloaded from https://www.mixamo.com as .fbx and exported using Blender glTF exporter. This conversion may have caused bone misalignment in some animations. Not caused by the engine itself.

Default assets are imported from /res folder at startup. Additional assets can be imported using file dialog.
